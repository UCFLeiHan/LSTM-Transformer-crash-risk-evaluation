# LSTM-Transformer-crash-risk-evaluation
## This is the source codes and modeling data for paper: LSTM + Transformer Real-Time Crash Risk Evaluation Using Traffic Flow and Risky Driving Behavior Data

### The codes are running in python 3.10.13.
### The LSTM and Transformer models are built using Tensorflow (2.10.1)
### The other baseline models (i.e., Logistic Regreesion, Support vector Machine, and XGBoost) are built using scikit-learn (1.3.0)
### The data processed for model training and testing includes: (1) Traffic flow data, (2) Risky driving behavior data, (3) Crash index data, and (4) Aggregated traffic flow and risky driving behavior data.
### Due to the data privacy, the raw data cannot be open to public. 
### Please feel free to contact the authors if you have any questions or issues.
